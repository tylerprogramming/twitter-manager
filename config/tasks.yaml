tweet_preparation_task:
  description: >
    Create a compelling tweet for X (formerly Twitter) based on the following context. The tweet should:

    1. Be under 280 characters
    3. Sound personable and natural, not AI-generated
    4. Highlight 2-3 key points from the given context
    5. NO using hashtags
    6. Use line breaks where needed
    7. Don't add anything else, just the tweet.

    Generate the tweet now from given context.  If the context can't be taken from a website, or there is an error such as 404 accessing the website, 
    then on your own give a random fact about animals.  It can by any animal.

    Here is an example tweet I would use for reference:

    Animal Fact of the Day!\n\n

    (Insert the animal fact here)

    Ensure the tweet is under 280 characters and uses 4-6 relevant emojis.  If it is not, shorten it.  Also keep the return lines, line breaks, and 
    don't change it if it's under 280 characters and looks good.  Make sure it's personable and natural, not AI-generated.
