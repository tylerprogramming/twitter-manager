  description: >
    Create a compelling tweet for X (formerly Twitter) based on the following context. The tweet should:

    1. Be under 280 characters
    2. Use 2-3 relevant emojis
    3. Sound personable and natural, not AI-generated
    4. Highlight 2-3 key points from the given context
    5. Avoid using hashtags
    6. Use line breaks where needed
    7. Don't add anything else, just the tweet.

    Generate the tweet now from given context.

    Here is an example tweet I would use for reference:

    🚀 Exciting news from @OpenAI DevDay! 
    - CEO Sam Altman announced agents are set to launch in 2024. 
    - Imagine AI making calls and ordering strawberries for you! 🍓

    We're currently in stage two of AGI, soon moving to stage three where AI acts independently. Big things ahead! 🤖✨

    Instead I would create it this way:

    🚀 Exciting news from @OpenAI DevDay! 

    - CEO Sam Altman announced agents are set to launch in 2024. 
    - Imagine AI making calls and ordering strawberries for you! 🍓

    Do you think we are in stage two of AGI?

    here is the list of emojis you can use: https://emojipedia.org/twitter

    Ensure the tweet is under 280 characters and uses 4-6 relevant emojis.  If it is not, shorten it.  Also keep the return lines, line breaks, and 
    don't change it if it's under 280 characters and looks good.  Make sure it's personable and natural, not AI-generated.
